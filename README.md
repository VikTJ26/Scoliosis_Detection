# Scoliosis Detection
Scoliosis Detection project implements various machine learning models—including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) — to accurately detect scoliosis from spinal X-ray images, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

Scoliosis is a spinal condition characterized by abnormal lateral curvature, which early diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project applies a comprehensive machine learning approach to identify and classify scoliosis from spinal X-ray images. Multiple models—such as Logistic Regression with StandardScaler, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and advanced deep learning via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)—are employed and compared for accuracy and reliability. Each model is trained on carefully processed and standardized datasets to ensure robustness. The goal is to provide medical professionals with a versatile diagnostic toolkit, leveraging both traditional classification methods and deep learning capabilities to enhance early detection, facilitate timely interventions, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes for patients with scoliosis.
